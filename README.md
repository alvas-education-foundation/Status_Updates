# Status_Updates
Daily Status Updates : Redefined.

Keep the Repo name in this format : ISE_3rd_year_Status_Updates

### Streamlining Status Updates

As you have you might have already noticed, sending daily reports in Word documents, is extremely boring and very hard to manage. 

Slack will be flooded with documents and GitHub bot's updates.

So, in order to get rid of all these issues, I am proposing this lightweight method for monitoring daily updates.

Students just have to clone this Repo, and create their own directories üìÅ inside it as per the template format. They can easily create .md files with dates, and will be extremely easy for faculties to monitor the status.
